# Introduction

This lecture provides an introduction to basic machine learning concepts tailored for applications in protein design and engineering. Throughout the lecture, we will explore key topics, including:

- **Classification** and **regression** in supervised learning.
- **Clustering** methods in unsupervised learning.

### What You'll Learn

1. **Classification Exercise**  
   - Train classification models to categorize different types of snake venoms.

2. **Regression Exercise**  
   - Build regression models in machine learning-guided directed evolution (MLDE) to predict mutations that enhance the catalytic activity of enzymes.

### How We'll Proceed

We will begin by implementing exercises from scratch using the popular machine learning library **scikit-learn**. Once you've gained foundational knowledge, we will introduce the **ProteusAI framework**, which streamlines these workflows significantly. The ProteusAI package will be explored in greater depth in subsequent lectures.

### Bonus Content

This directory also includes a **bonus lecture on Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN)** for those interested in the foundations of modern AI technologies. If you're new to this subject, I highly recommend reviewing the FFNN material, as a basic understanding will be assumed in later lectures.
