# ML4Proteins
Welcome to **ML4Proteins**! Here you will learn about the concepts and methods of machine learning for protein engineering using [ProteusAI](https://github.com/jonfunk21/ProteusAI).

## Getting Started
To get started with the course material, please clone [ProteusAI](https://github.com/jonfunk21/ProteusAI) and follow the installation instructions.
If the installation is successful, you should be able to activate the `proteusAI` environment.

```bash
conda activate proteusAI
```
Verfiy that the environment installed successfully by opening and importing proteusAI in `python`.

```python
import proteusAI as pai
print(pai.__version__)
```
This should print the current `pai` version.

## Next Steps
Once your environment is set up and ready, you can proceed to the course content.

Happy Learning!
